<p><strong>The High Blood Pressure Drugs (Hypertension) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>ACEI</li><li>CCB</li><li>ARB</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The high blood pressure drugs market comprises several key classes: ACE inhibitors (ACEI), calcium channel blockers (CCB), and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). ACEIs work by preventing the formation of a hormone that narrows blood vessels, promoting relaxation and lowering pressure. CCBs inhibit calcium entry into cells, leading to relaxed vascular smooth muscles and reduced resistance. ARBs block the action of angiotensin II, a substance that constricts blood vessels. Together, these medications effectively manage hypertension and improve cardiovascular health.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Turbidity Curtains Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Floating</li><li>Staked</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The turbidity curtains market is primarily segmented into two types: floating and staked. Floating turbidity curtains are designed to float on the water's surface, creating a barrier to contain sediments and prevent them from dispersing during construction or dredging activities. Staked turbidity curtains, on the other hand, are anchored to the seabed or riverbed, providing increased stability in turbulent waters. Both types are used to enhance water clarity and protect aquatic ecosystems by minimizing sediment disturbance and pollution.</p></p>

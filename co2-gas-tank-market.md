<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CO2 Gas Tank Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Siphon Gas Tank</li><li>Anti-siphon Gas Tank</li><li>Ordinary Gas Tank</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CO2 gas tank market includes three primary types: siphon gas tanks, anti-siphon gas tanks, and ordinary gas tanks. Siphon gas tanks are designed to allow liquid CO2 to be drawn easily using siphoning methods, making them suitable for beverage carbonation. Anti-siphon gas tanks prevent liquid CO2 from flowing out, ensuring only gas is dispensed, ideal for consistent gas supply in various applications. Ordinary gas tanks simply store CO2 and deliver it as needed but lack specialized siphoning features.</p></p>

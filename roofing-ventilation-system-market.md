<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Roofing Ventilation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Roofing Ventilation System</li><li>Passive Roofing Ventilation System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The roofing ventilation system market is divided into two primary types: active and passive systems. Active roofing ventilation systems utilize mechanical devices, such as fans, to enhance airflow, improving temperature control and moisture removal within attics. These systems are more effective in challenging climates. In contrast, passive roofing ventilation systems rely on natural airflow through vents, including ridge, soffit, and gable vents, to regulate heat and moisture without mechanical assistance. Both systems aim to prevent damage and improve energy efficiency in buildings.</p></p>
